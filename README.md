Dinh, Q. V., Todesco Pereira, P. H., Dinh, V. N., Nagle, A. J., and Leahy, P. G. (2024). ‘Levelised cost of transmission comparison for green hydrogen and ammonia in new-build offshore energy infrastructure: Pipelines, tankers, and HVDC’, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 62, pp. 684–698. Available at: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.066>.

## Highlights of the paper

- Future hydrogen and ammonia markets will require new-build long-distance transmission.
- Energy may be transmitted in dedicated pipelines, liquid tankers or by HVDC lines.
- Levelised cost of transmission depends on the transferred quantity and the distance.
- Pipelines are the best option over short distances for hydrogen and ammonia.
- HVDC has lowest cost for medium distances, tankers are suitable for long distances.
